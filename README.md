#  Show or Hide All Apps
A small Mac application to show or hide all applications on your desktop. It helps you cleaning up your desktop, and it's handy for very busy people with many opened windows.

## Installation
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Roman1001/show-hide-apps/releases/latest), go to the downloads on the bottom of the page, and download your preferred version of the app:

- The DMG file is a disk copy file, containing the app.
- The ZIP file contains the app too.
- The two source code files (ZIP archive and TAR ball) are containing the source code.

Drop the downloaded app in your applications folder, and you can now use it!

## Usage

- Show All: show all opened apps.
- Hide All: hide all opened apps.
- Quit: quit the application (**only** this app!).

## Translations
The app supports the following languages:

- English (dev lang)
